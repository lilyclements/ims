## Figures Needed

The following 7 figures are referenced but need to be generated from the QMD source:

1. `images/exercises/_21-ex-inference-paired-means-06.png` - HSB randomization test
2. `images/exercises/_21-ex-inference-paired-means-07.png` - Global warming randomization
3. `images/exercises/_21-ex-inference-paired-means-08.png` - HSB bootstrap interval
4. `images/exercises/_21-ex-inference-paired-means-09.png` - Global warming bootstrap
5. `images/exercises/_21-ex-inference-paired-means-11.png` - Global warming mathematical test
6. `images/exercises/_21-ex-inference-paired-means-16.png` - Friday 13th traffic
7. `images/exercises/_21-ex-inference-paired-means-17.png` - Friday 13th accidents

## How to Generate Figures

These figures need to be generated by rendering the exercises QMD file:

```bash
# In an environment with R and Quarto installed:
cd /path/to/ims
quarto render exercises/_21-ex-inference-paired-means.qmd
```

Or by running the R code blocks from the QMD file directly and saving outputs to the `images/exercises/` directory.

## Dependencies

The figure generation requires:
- R (with tidyverse, openintro, infer, patchwork packages)
- Quarto

## Next Steps

1. Render the exercise QMD file to generate the PNG images
2. Verify images are in the correct location (`images/exercises/`)
3. Build the PreTeXt book to verify exercises display correctly
