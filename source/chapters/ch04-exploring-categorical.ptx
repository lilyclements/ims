  <title>Exploring categorical data</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p>
      This chapter focuses on exploring <alert>categorical</alert> data using summary statistics and visualizations.
      The summaries and graphs presented in this chapter are created using statistical software; however, since this might be your first exposure to the concepts, we take our time in this chapter to detail how to create them.
      Where possible, we present multivariate plots; plots that visualize the relationship between multiple variables.
      Mastery of the content presented in this chapter will be crucial for understanding the methods and techniques introduced in the rest of the book.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In this chapter we will work with data on loans from Lending Club that you've previously seen in <xref ref="sec-data-hello" />.
      The <c>loan50</c> dataset from <xref ref="sec-data-hello" /> represents a sample from a larger loan dataset called <c>loans</c>.
      This larger dataset contains information on 10,000 loans made through Lending Club.
      We will examine the relationship between <c>homeownership</c>, which for the <c>loans</c> data can take a value of <c>rent</c>, <c>mortgage</c> (owns but has a mortgage), or <c>own</c>, and <c>application_type</c>, which indicates whether the loan application was made with a partner or whether it was an individual application.

      <title>Data</title>
      <p>
        The <url href="http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/loans_full_schema.html"><c>loans_full_schema</c></url> data can be found in the <url href="http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro"><term>openintro</term></url> R package.
        Based on the data in this dataset we have modified the <c>homeownership</c> and <c>application_type</c> variables.
        We will refer to this modified dataset as <c>loans</c>.

    <title>Contingency tables and bar plots</title>
    
    <p>
      <xref ref="tbl-loan-home-app-type-totals" /> summarizes two variables: <c>application_type</c> and <c>homeownership</c>.
      Note that loans from Lending Club are typically for small items or for cash, not for homes.
      The individuals in the dataset are taking out loans for their personal use, and we categorize them based on their <c>homeownership</c> status (which is unrelated to the purpose of the loan).
      A table that summarizes data for two categorical variables in this way is called a <term>contingency table</term><idx>contingency table</idx>.
      Each value in the table represents the number of times a particular combination of variable outcomes occurred.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For example, the value 3496 corresponds to the number of loans in the dataset where the borrower rents their home and the application type was by an individual.
      Row and column totals are also included.
      The <term>row totals</term><idx>row totals</idx> provide the total counts across each row and the <term>column totals</term><idx>column totals</idx> down each column.
      We can also create a table that shows only the overall percentages or proportions for each combination of categories, or we can create a table for a single variable, such as the one shown in <xref ref="tbl-loan-homeownership-totals" /> for the <c>homeownership</c> variable.

      <title>Bar plots with two variables</title>
      
      <p>
        We can display the distributions of two categorical variables on a bar plot concurrently.
        Such plots are generally useful for visualizing the relationship between two categorical variables.
        <xref ref="fig-loan-homeownership-app-type-bar-plot" /> shows three such plots that visualize the relationship between <c>homeownership</c> and <c>application_type</c>.
        <xref ref="fig-loan-homeownership-app-type-bar-plot-1" /> is a <term>stacked bar plot</term><idx>stacked bar plot</idx><idx><h>plot</h><h>stacked bar</h></idx>.
        This plot most clearly displays that loan applicants most commonly live in mortgaged homes.
        It is difficult to say, based on this plot alone, how different application types vary across the levels of homeownership.
        <xref ref="fig-loan-homeownership-app-type-bar-plot-2" /> is a <term>standardized bar plot</term><idx>standardized bar plot</idx><idx><h>plot</h><h>standardized bar</h></idx> (also known as <term>filled bar plot</term><idx>filled bar plot</idx><idx><h>plot</h><h>filled bar</h></idx>).
        This type of visualization is helpful in understanding the fraction of individual or joint loan applications for borrowers in each level of <c>homeownership</c>.
        Additionally, since the proportions of joint and individual loans vary across the groups, we can conclude that the two variables are associated for this sample.
        Finally, <xref ref="fig-loan-homeownership-app-type-bar-plot-3" /> is a <term>dodged bar plot</term><idx>dodged bar plot</idx><idx><h>plot</h><h>dodged bar</h></idx>.
        This plot most clearly displays that within each level of homeownership, individual applications are more common than joint applications.
        This plot most clearly displays that joint applications are most common among loans for applicants who live in mortgaged homes, compared to renters and owners.

      <example>
        <title>Worked Example</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Examine the three bar plots in <xref ref="fig-loan-homeownership-app-type-bar-plot" />.
            When is the stacked, dodged, or standardized bar plot the most useful?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The stacked bar plot is most useful when it's reasonable to assign one variable as the explanatory variable (here <c>homeownership</c>) and the other variable as the response (here <c>application_type</c>) since we are effectively grouping by one variable first and then breaking it down by the others.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Dodged bar plots are more agnostic in their display about which variable, if any, represents the explanatory and which the response variable.
            It is also easy to discern the number of cases in each of the six different group combinations.
            However, one downside is that it tends to require more horizontal space; the narrowness of Plot B compared to the other two in <xref ref="fig-loan-homeownership-app-type-bar-plot" /> makes the plot feel a bit cramped.
            Additionally, when two groups are of very different sizes, as we see in the group <c>own</c> relative to either of the other two groups, it is difficult to discern if there is an association between the variables.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The standardized stacked bar plot is helpful if the primary variable in the stacked bar plot is relatively imbalanced, e.g., the category has only a third of the observations in the category, making the simple stacked bar plot less useful for checking for an association.
            The major downside of the standardized version is that we lose all sense of how many cases each of the bars represents.
          </p>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-mosaic-plots">
      <title>Mosaic plots</title>
      
      <p>
        A <term>mosaic plot</term><idx>mosaic plot</idx><idx><h>plot</h><h>mosaic</h></idx> is a visualization technique suitable for contingency tables that resembles a standardized stacked bar plot with the benefit that we still see the relative group sizes of the primary variable as well.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        To get started in creating our first mosaic plot, we'll break a square into columns for each category of the variable, with the result shown in <xref ref="fig-loan-homeownership-type-mosaic-plot-1" />.
        Each column represents a level of <c>homeownership</c>, and the column widths correspond to the proportion of loans in each of those categories.
        For instance, there are fewer loans where the borrower is an owner than where the borrower has a mortgage.
        In general, mosaic plots use box <em>areas</em> to represent the number of cases in each category.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <xref ref="fig-loan-homeownership-type-mosaic-plot-2" /> displays the relationship between homeownership and application type.
        Each column is split proportionally to the number of loans from individual and joint borrowers.
        For example, the second column represents loans where the borrower has a mortgage, and it was divided into individual loans (upper) and joint loans (lower).
        As another example, the bottom segment of the third column represents loans where the borrower owns their home and applied jointly, while the upper segment of this column represents borrowers who are homeowners and filed individually.
        We can again use this plot to see that the <c>homeownership</c> and <c>application_type</c> variables are associated, since some columns are divided in different vertical locations than others, which was the same technique used for checking an association in the standardized stacked bar plot.

        In <xref ref="fig-loan-homeownership-type-mosaic-plot" />, we chose to first split by the homeowner status of the borrower.
        However, we could have instead first split by the application type, as in <xref ref="fig-loan-app-type-mosaic-plot" />.
        Like with the bar plots, it's common to use the explanatory variable to represent the first split in a mosaic plot, and then for the response to break up each level of the explanatory variable if these labels are reasonable to attach to the variables under consideration.

      In the previous sections we inspected visualizations of two categorical variables in bar plots and mosaic plots.
      However, we have not discussed how the values in the bar and mosaic plots that show proportions are calculated.
      In this section we will investigate fractional breakdown of one variable in another and we can modify our contingency table to provide such a view.
      <xref ref="tbl-loan-home-app-type-row-proportions" /> shows <term>row proportions</term><idx>row proportions</idx> for <xref ref="tbl-loan-home-app-type-totals" />, which are computed as the counts divided by their row totals.
      The value 3496 at the intersection of individual and rent is replaced by <m>3496 / 8505 = 0.411,</m> i.e., 3496 divided by its row total, 8505.
      So, what does 0.411 represent?
      It corresponds to the proportion of individual applicants who rent.

      <xref ref="tbl-loan-home-app-type-column-proportions" /> shows such a table, and here the value 0.906 indicates that 90.6% of renters applied as individuals for the loan.
      This rate is higher compared to loans from people with mortgages (80.2%) or who own their home (86.5%).
      Because these rates vary between the three levels of <c>homeownership</c> (<c>rent</c>, <c>mortgage</c>, <c>own</c>), this provides evidence that <c>application_type</c> and <c>homeownership</c> variables may be associated.

      We could also have checked for an association between <c>application_type</c> and <c>homeownership</c> in <xref ref="tbl-loan-home-app-type-row-proportions" /> using row proportions.
      When comparing these row proportions, we would look down columns to see if the fraction of loans where the borrower rents, has a mortgage, or owns varied across the application types.

      <title>Worked Example</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Data scientists use statistics to build email spam filters.
          By noting specific characteristics of an email, a data scientist may be able to classify some emails as spam or not spam with high accuracy.
          One such characteristic is the email format, which indicates whether an email has any HTML content, such as bolded text.
          We'll focus on email format and spam status using the dataset; these variables are summarized in a contingency table in <xref ref="tbl-email-count-table" />.
          Which would be more helpful to someone hoping to classify email as spam or regular email for this table: row or column proportions?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          A data scientist would be interested in how the proportion of spam changes within each email format.
          This corresponds to column proportions: the proportion of spam in plain text emails and the proportion of spam in HTML emails.
          If we generate the column proportions, we can see that a higher fraction of plain text emails are spam (<m>209/1195 = 17.5\%</m>) than compared to HTML emails (<m>158/2726 = 5.8\%</m>).
          This information on its own is insufficient to classify an email as spam or not spam, as over 80% of plain text emails are not spam.
          Yet, when we carefully combine this information with many other characteristics, we stand a reasonable chance of being able to classify some emails as spam or not spam with confidence.
          This example points out that row and column proportions are not equivalent.
          Before settling on one form for a table, it is important to consider each to ensure that the most useful table is constructed.
          However, sometimes it simply isn't clear which, if either, is more useful.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          None that we think are obvious!
          What is distinct about the email example is that the two loan variables do not have a clear explanatory-response variable relationship that we might hypothesize.
          Usually it is most useful to "condition" on the explanatory variable.
          For instance, in the email example, the email format was seen as a possible explanatory variable of whether the message was spam, so we would find it more interesting to compute the relative frequencies (proportions) for each email format.

      Pie charts can work well when the goal is to visualize a categorical variable with very few levels, and especially if each level represents a simple fraction (e.g., one-half, one-quarter, etc.).
      However, they can be quite difficult to read when they are used to visualize a categorical variable with many levels.
      For example, the pie chart <xref ref="fig-loan-grade-pie-chart-1" /> and the bar plot <xref ref="fig-loan-grade-pie-chart-2" /> both represent the distribution of loan grades (A through G).
      In this case, it is far easier to compare the counts of each loan grade using the bar plot than the pie chart.

    <p>
      Some of the more interesting investigations can be considered by examining numerical data across groups.
      In this section we will expand on a few methods we have already seen to make plots for numerical data from multiple groups on the same graph as well as introduce a few new methods for comparing numerical data across groups.

      We will revisit the <c>county</c> dataset and compare the median household income for counties that gained population from 2010 to 2017 versus counties that had no gain.
      While we might like to make a causal connection between income and population growth, remember that these are observational data and so such an interpretation would be, at best, half-baked.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We have data on 3142 counties in the United States.
      We are missing 2017 population data from 65 of them, and of the remaining 3077 counties, in 1711 the population increased from 2010 to 2017 and in the remaining 1366 the population decreased.

          Use the plots in <xref ref="fig-countyIncomeSplitByPopGain" /> to compare the incomes for counties across the two groups.
          What do you notice about the approximate center of each group?
          What do you notice about the variability between groups?
          Is the shape relatively consistent between groups?
          How many <em>prominent</em> modes are there for each group?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Answers may vary a little.
          The counties with population gains tend to have higher income (median of about $45,000) versus counties without a gain (median of about $40,000).
          The variability is also slightly larger for the population gain group.
          This is evident in the IQR, which is about 50% bigger in the <em>gain</em> group.
          Both distributions show slight to moderate right skew and are unimodal.
          The box plots indicate there are many observations far above the median in each group, though we should anticipate that many observations will fall beyond the whiskers when examining any dataset that contain more than a few hundred data points.

      One last visualization technique we'll highlight for comparing numerical data across groups is <term>faceting</term><idx>faceting</idx><idx>faceted plot</idx><idx><h>plot</h><h>faceted</h></idx>.
      In this technique we split (facet) the graphical display of the data across plotting windows based on groups.
      <xref ref="fig-countyIncomeSplitByPopGainFacetHist-1" /> displays the same information as <xref ref="fig-countyIncomeSplitByPopGain-1" />, however here the distributions of median household income for counties with and without population gain are faceted across two plotting windows.
      We preserve the same scale on the x and y axes for easier comparison.
      An advantage of this approach is that it extends to splitting the data across levels of two categorical variables, which allows for displaying relationships between three variables.
      In <xref ref="fig-countyIncomeSplitByPopGainFacetHist-2" /> we have now split the data into four groups using the <c>pop_change</c> and <c>metro</c> variables:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>top left represents counties that are <em>not</em> in a metropolitan area with population gain,</p></li>

          Based on <xref ref="fig-countyIncomeRidgeMulti" />, what can you say about how median household income in counties vary depending on population gain/no gain, metropolitan area/not, and median degree?

      <solution>
        <p>
          Regardless of the location (metropolitan or not) or change in population, it seems like there is an increase in median household income from individuals with only a HS diploma, to individuals with some college, to individuals with a Bachelor's degree.

      <p>
        Fluently working with categorical variables is an important skill for data analysts.
        In this chapter we have introduced different visualizations and numerical summaries applied to categorical variables.
        The graphical visualizations are even more descriptive when two variables are presented simultaneously.
        We presented bar plots, mosaic plots, pie charts, and estimations of conditional proportions.

        <statement>
          <p>
            The US House of Representatives is dominated by two political parties: Democrats and Republicans. Democrats are thought to be the more liberal party and Republicans are considered to be the more conservative party. However, within each party there is an internal spectrum of liberal to conservative. For example, conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans would be labeled moderate. Consider an election where the only change in membership is that the most conservative Democrats are replaced by a set of liberal Republicans who are more liberal than the incumbent Republicans but more conservative than the Democrats they replaced.
