  <title>Inference with mathematical models</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>In <xref ref="ch11-hypothesis-testing-randomization" text="title" /> and <xref ref="ch12-confidence-intervals-bootstrapping" text="title" /> questions about population parameters were addressed using computational techniques.</p>

    <p>With randomization tests, the data were permuted assuming the null hypothesis.</p>

    <p>With bootstrapping, the data were resampled in order to measure the variability.</p>

    <p>In many cases (indeed, with sample proportions), the variability of the statistic can be described by the computational method (as in previous chapters) or by a mathematical formula (as in this chapter).</p>

    <p>The normal distribution is presented here to describe the variability associated with sample proportions which are taken from either repeated samples or repeated experiments.</p>

    <p>The normal distribution is quite powerful in that it describes the variability of many different statistics, and we will encounter the normal distribution throughout the remainder of the book.</p>

    <p>For now, however, focus is on the parallels between how data can provide insight about a research question either through computational methods or through mathematical models.</p>

  <section xml:id="sec-CLTsection">
    <title>Central Limit Theorem</title>

    <p>In recent chapters, we have encountered four case studies.</p>

    <p>While they differ in the settings, in their outcomes, and in the technique we have used to analyze the data, they all have something in common: the general shape of the distribution of the statistics (called the <alert>sampling distribution</alert>).\index{sampling distribution} You may have noticed that the distributions were symmetric and bell-shaped.</p>

    <assemblage>
      <p><alert>Sampling distribution.</alert></p>

      <p>A sampling distribution is the distribution of all possible values of a <em>sample statistic</em> from samples of a given sample size from a given population.</p>

      <p>We can think about the sample distribution as describing how sample statistics (e.g., the sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> or the sample mean <m>\bar{x}</m>) varies from one study to another.</p>

      <p>A sampling distribution is contrasted with a data distribution which shows the variability of the <em>observed</em> data values.</p>

      <p>The data distribution can be visualized from the observations themselves.</p>

      <p>However, because a sampling distribution describes sample statistics computed from many studies, it cannot be visualized directly from a single dataset.</p>

      <p>Instead, we use either computational or mathematical structures to estimate the sampling distribution and hence to describe the expected variability of the sample statistic in repeated studies.</p>

    </assemblage>

    <p><xref ref="fig-FourCaseStudies" /> shows the null distributions in each of the four case studies where we ran 10,000 simulations.</p>

    <p>Note that the <alert>null distribution</alert>\index{null distribution} is the sampling distribution of the statistic created under the setting where the null hypothesis is true.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the null distribution will always be centered at the value of the parameter given by the null hypothesis.</p>

    <p>In the case of the opportunity cost study, which originally had just 1,000 simulations, we have included an additional 9,000 simulations.</p>

        <p>Describe the shape of the distributions and note anything that you find interesting.</p>

        <solution>
        <p>In general, the distributions are reasonably symmetric.</p>

      <p>The case study for the medical consultant is the only distribution with any evident skew.</p>
    </subsection>

    <p>As we observed in <xref ref="sec-data-hello" text="title" />, it's common for distributions to be skewed or contain outliers.</p>

    <p>However, the null distributions we have so far encountered have all looked somewhat similar and, for the most part, symmetric.</p>

    <p>They all resemble a bell-shaped curve.</p>

    <p>The bell-shaped curve similarity is not a coincidence, but rather, is guaranteed by mathematical theory.</p>

    <assemblage>
      <p><alert>Central Limit Theorem for proportions.</alert>\index{Central Limit Theorem}</p>

      <p>If we look at a proportion (or difference in proportions) and the scenario satisfies certain conditions, then the sample proportion (or difference in proportions) will appear to follow a bell-shaped curve called the <em>normal distribution</em>.</p>

    </assemblage>

    <p>An example of a perfect normal distribution is shown in <xref ref="fig-simpleNormal" />.</p>

    <p>Imagine laying a normal curve over each of the four null distributions in <xref ref="fig-FourCaseStudies" />.</p>

    <p>While the mean (center) and standard deviation (width or spread) may change for each plot, the general shape remains roughly intact.</p>

    <figure xml:id="fig-simpleNormal">
      <caption>A normal curve.</caption>
      <image source="images/fig-simpleNormal.png" width="70%" />
    </figure>

    <p>Mathematical theory guarantees that if repeated samples are taken a sample proportion or a difference in sample proportions will follow something that resembles a normal distribution when certain conditions are met.</p>

    <p>(Note: we typically only take <alert>one</alert> sample, but the mathematical model lets us know what to expect if we <em>had</em> taken repeated samples.) These conditions fall into two general categories describing the independence between observations and the need to take a sufficiently large sample size.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Observations in the sample are <alert>independent</alert>.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Independence is guaranteed when we take a random sample from a population.</p>

    <p>Independence can also be guaranteed if we randomly divide individuals into treatment and control groups.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>The sample is <alert>large enough</alert>.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The sample size cannot be too small.</p>

    <p>What qualifies as <q>small</q> differs from one context to the next, and we'll provide suitable guidelines for proportions in <xref ref="ch16-inference-single-proportion" text="title" />.</p>

    <p>So far we have had no need for the normal distribution.</p>

    <p>We've been able to answer our questions somewhat easily using simulation techniques.</p>

    <p>However, soon this will change.</p>

    <p>Simulating data can be non-trivial.</p>

    <p>For example, some of the scenarios encountered in <xref ref="sec-model-mlr" text="title" /> where we introduced regression models with multiple predictors would require complex simulations in order to make inferential conclusions.</p>

    <p>Instead, the normal distribution and other distributions like it offer a general framework for statistical inference that applies to a very large number of settings.</p>

    <assemblage>
      <p><alert>Technical Conditions.</alert></p>

      <p>In order for the normal approximation to describe the sampling distribution of the sample proportion as it varies from sample to sample, two conditions must hold.</p>

      <p>If these conditions do not hold, it is unwise to use the normal distribution (and related concepts like Z scores, probabilities from the normal curve, etc.) for inferential analyses.</p>

    <title>Normal Distribution</title>

    <p>Among all the distributions we see in statistics, one is overwhelmingly the most common.</p>

    <p>The symmetric, unimodal, bell curve is ubiquitous throughout statistics.</p>

    <p>It is so common that people know it as a variety of names including the <alert>normal curve</alert>\index{normal curve}, <alert>normal model</alert>\index{normal model}, or <alert>normal distribution</alert>\index{normal distribution}.[^13-foundations-mathematical-2]</p>

    <p>Under certain conditions, sample proportions, sample means, and sample differences can be modeled using the normal distribution.</p>

    <p>Additionally, some variables such as SAT scores and heights of US adult males closely follow the normal distribution.</p>

    <assemblage>
      <p><alert>Normal distribution facts.</alert></p>

      <p>Distributions of many variables are nearly normal, but none are exactly normal.</p>

      <p>Thus, the normal distribution, while not perfect for any single problem, is very useful for a variety of problems.</p>

    </assemblage>

    <p>In this section, we will discuss the normal distribution in the context of data to become familiar with normal distribution techniques.</p>

    <p>In the following sections and beyond, we'll move our discussion to focus on applying the normal distribution and other related distributions to model point estimates for hypothesis tests and for constructing confidence intervals.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-normal-distribution-model">
      <title>Normal distribution model</title>

    <p>The normal distribution always describes a symmetric, unimodal, bell-shaped curve.</p>

    <p>However, normal curves can look different depending on the details of the model.</p>

    <p>Specifically, the normal model can be adjusted using two parameters: mean and standard deviation.</p>

    <p>As you can probably guess, changing the mean shifts the bell curve to the left or right, while changing the standard deviation stretches or constricts the curve.</p>

    <p><xref ref="fig-twoSampleNormals" /> shows the normal distribution with mean <m>0</m> and standard deviation <m>1</m> (which is commonly referred to as the <alert>standard normal distribution</alert>\index{standard normal distribution}).</p>

    <p>A normal distribution with mean <m>19</m> and standard deviation <m>4</m> is shown on the right.</p>

    <p><xref ref="fig-twoSampleNormalsStacked" /> shows the same two normal distributions on the same axis.</p>

    <p>If a normal distribution has mean <m>\mu</m> and standard deviation <m>\sigma,</m> we may write the distribution as <m>N(\mu, \sigma).</m> The two distributions in <xref ref="fig-twoSampleNormalsStacked" /> can be written as</p>

    <me>
      N(\mu = 0, \sigma = 1)\quad\text{and}\quad N(\mu = 19, \sigma = 4)
    </me>

    <p>Because the mean and standard deviation describe a normal distribution exactly, they are called the distribution's <alert>parameters</alert>\index{parameter}.</p>

      <statement>
        <p>Write down the short-hand for a normal distribution with the following parameters.</p>

      <p>Suppose Nel scored 1800 points on their SAT and Sian scored 24 points on their ACT.</p>
      <p>Who performed better?</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
      <p>We use the standard deviation as a guide.</p>
      <p>Nel is 1 standard deviation above average on the SAT: <m>1500 + 300 = 1800.</m> Sian is 0.6 standard deviations above the mean on the ACT: <m>21+0.6 \times 5 = 24.</m> In <xref ref="fig-satActNormals" />, we can see that Nel did better compared to other test takers than Sian did, so their score was better.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-standardizing-z-scores">
      <title>Standardizing with Z scores</title>

    <p>The solution to the previous example relies on a standardization technique called a Z score, a method most commonly employed for nearly normal observations (but that may be used with any distribution).</p>

    <p>The <alert>Z score</alert>\index{Z score} of an observation is defined as the number of standard deviations it falls above or below the mean.</p>

    <p>If the observation is one standard deviation above the mean, its Z score is 1.</p>

    <p>If it is 1.5 standard deviations <em>below</em> the mean, then its Z score is -1.5.</p>

    <p>If <m>x</m> is an observation from a distribution <m>N(\mu, \sigma),</m> we define the Z score mathematically as</p>

    <me>
      Z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}
    </me>

    <p>Using <m>\mu_{SAT}=1500,</m> <m>\sigma_{SAT}=300,</m> and <m>x_{Nel}=1800,</m> we find Nel's Z score:</p>

    <me>
      Z_{Nel} = \frac{x_{Nel} - \mu_{SAT}}{\sigma_{SAT}} = \frac{1800-1500}{300} = 1
    </me>

    <assemblage>
      <p><alert>The Z score.</alert></p>

      <p>The Z score of an observation is the number of standard deviations it falls above or below the mean.</p>

      <p>We compute the Z score for an observation <m>x</m> that follows a distribution with mean <m>\mu</m> and standard deviation <m>\sigma</m> using</p>

      <me>
        Z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}
      </me>

      <p>If the observation <m>x</m> comes from a <em>normal</em> distribution centered at <m>\mu</m> with standard deviation of <m>\sigma</m>, then the Z score will be distributed according to a <em>normal</em> distribution with a center of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.</p>

      <p>That is, the normality remains when transforming from <m>x</m> to <m>Z</m> with a shift in both the center as well as the spread.</p>

    </assemblage>

    <exercise>
      <title>Guided Practice</title>
      <statement>
      <p>Use Sian's ACT score, 24, along with the ACT mean and standard deviation to compute their Z score.</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
      <p><m>Z_{Sian} = \frac{x_{Sian} - \mu_{ACT}}{\sigma_{ACT}} = \frac{24 - 21}{5} = 0.6</m></p>
      </solution>
    </exercise>

    <p>Observations above the mean always have positive Z scores while those below the mean have negative Z scores.</p>

    <p>If an observation is equal to the mean (e.g., SAT score of 1500), then the Z score is <m>0.</m></p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>Let <m>X</m> represent a random variable from <m>N(\mu=3, \sigma=2),</m> and suppose we observe <m>x=5.19.</m> Find the Z score of <m>x.</m> Then, use the Z score to determine how many standard deviations above or below the mean <m>x</m> falls.</p>

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>Its Z score is given by <m>Z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} = \frac{5.19 - 3}{2} = 2.19/2 = 1.095.</m> The observation <m>x</m> is 1.095 standard deviations <em>above</em> the mean.</p>

        <p>We know it must be above the mean since <m>Z</m> is positive.</p>

      </solution>
    </example>

    <exercise>
      <title>Guided Practice</title>
      <statement>
      <p>Head lengths of brushtail possums follow a nearly normal distribution with mean 92.6 mm and standard deviation 3.6 mm.</p>
      <p>Compute the Z scores for possums with head lengths of 95.4 mm and 85.8 mm.</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
      <p>For <m>x_1=95.4</m> mm: <m>Z_1 = \frac{x_1 - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{95.4 - 92.6}{3.6} = 0.78.</m> For <m>x_2=85.8</m> mm: <m>Z_2 = \frac{85.8 - 92.6}{3.6} = -1.89.</m></p>
      </solution>
    </exercise>

    <p>We can use Z scores to roughly identify which observations are more unusual than others.</p>

    <p>One observation <m>x_1</m> is said to be more unusual than another observation <m>x_2</m> if the absolute value of its Z score is larger than the absolute value of the other observation's Z score: <m>|Z_1| > |Z_2|.</m> This technique is especially insightful when a distribution is symmetric.</p>

    <exercise>
      <title>Guided Practice</title>
      <statement>
      <p>Which of the two brushtail possum observations in the previous guided practice is more <em>unusual</em>?</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
      <p>Because the <em>absolute value</em> of Z score for the second observation is larger than that of the first, the second observation has a more unusual head length.</p>

        <p>The total area under the normal curve is always equal to 1, and the proportion of people who scored below Nel on the SAT is equal to the <em>area</em> shaded in <xref ref="fig-satBelow1800" />: 0.8413.</p>

    <p>We can use the normal model to find percentiles or probabilities.</p>

    <p>A <alert>normal probability table</alert>\index{normal probability table}, which lists Z scores and corresponding percentiles, can be used to identify a percentile based on the Z score (and vice versa).</p>

    <p>Statistical software can also be used.</p>

    <p>Normal probabilities are most commonly found using statistical software which we will show here using R.</p>

    <p>We use the software to identify the percentile corresponding to any particular Z score.</p>

    <p>For instance, the percentile of <m>Z=0.43</m> is 0.6664, or the <m>66.64^{th}</m> percentile.</p>

    <p>The <c>pnorm()</c> function is available in default R and will provide the percentile associated with any cutoff on a normal curve.</p>

    <p>The <c>normTail()</c> function is available in the <url href="http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/"><alert>openintro</alert></url> R package and will draw the associated normal distribution curve.</p>

    <p>We can also find the Z score associated with a percentile.</p>

    <p>For example, to identify Z for the <m>80^{th}</m> percentile, we use <c>qnorm()</c> which identifies the <alert>quantile</alert> for a given percentage.</p>

        <p>Shannon is a randomly selected SAT taker, and nothing is known about Shannon's SAT aptitude.</p>

        <p>What is the probability that Shannon scores at least 1630 on their SATs?</p>

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>First, always draw and label a picture of the normal distribution.</p>

        <p>(Drawings need not be exact to be useful.) We are interested in the chance they score above 1630, so we shade the upper tail.</p>

        <p>See the normal curve below.</p>

        <p>The <m>x</m>-axis identifies the mean and the values at 2 standard deviations above and below the mean.</p>

        <p>The simplest way to find the shaded area under the curve makes use of the Z score of the cutoff value.</p>

        <p>With <m>\mu=1500,</m> <m>\sigma=300,</m> and the cutoff value <m>x=1630,</m> the Z score is computed as</p>

        </me>

        <p>We use software to find the percentile of <m>Z=0.43,</m> which yields 0.6664.</p>

        <p>However, the percentile describes those who had a Z score <em>lower</em> than 0.43.</p>

        <p>To find the area <em>above</em> <m>Z=0.43,</m> we compute one minus the area of the lower tail, as seen below.</p>

        <p>Yousef's height is at the <m>40^{th}</m> percentile.</p>

        <p>How tall are they?</p>

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>As always, first draw the picture.</p>

        <p>In this case, the lower tail probability is known (0.40), which can be shaded on the diagram.</p>

        <p>We want to find the observation that corresponds to the known probability of 0.4.</p>

        <p>We can find the observation in two different ways: using the height curve seen above or using the Z score associated with the standard normal curve centered at zero with a standard deviation of one.</p>

        <p>If you have access to software (like R, code seen below) that allows you to specify the mean and standard deviation of the normal curve, you can calculate the observed value on the curve (i.e., Yousef's height) directly.</p>

        <p>Yousef is 69.2 inches tall.</p>

        <p>That is, Yousef is about 5'9" (this is notation for 5-feet, 9-inches).</p>

        <p>Without access to flexible software, you will need the information given by a standard normal curve (a normal curve centered at zero with a standard deviation of one).</p>

        <p>First, determine the Z score associated with the <m>40^{th}</m> percentile.</p>

        <p>Because the percentile is below 50%, we know <m>Z</m> will be negative.</p>

        <p>Statistical software provides the <m>Z</m> value to be <m>-0.25.</m></p>

        <p>Knowing <m>Z_{Yousef}=-0.25</m> and the population parameters <m>\mu=70</m> and <m>\sigma=3.3</m> inches, the Z score formula can be set up to determine Yousef's unknown height, labeled <m>x_{Yousef}</m>:</p>

        <me>
          -0.253 = Z_{Yousef} = \frac{x_{Yousef} - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{x_{Yousef} - 70}{3.3}
        </me>

        <p>Solving for <m>x_{Yousef}</m> yields the height 69.2 inches.</p>

        <p>Again, Yousef is about 5'9".</p>

        <p>In order to practice using Z scores, we will use the standard normal curve to solve the problem.</p>

        <p>Again, we draw the figure first.</p>

        <p>And calculate the Z value associated with the <m>82^{nd}</m> percentile:</p>

        <p>Next, we want to find the Z score at the <m>82^{nd}</m> percentile, which will be a positive value (because the percentile is bigger than 50%).</p>

        <p>Using <c>qnorm()</c>, the <m>82^{nd}</m> percentile corresponds to <m>Z=0.92.</m> Finally, the height <m>x</m> is found using the Z score formula with the known mean <m>\mu,</m> standard deviation <m>\sigma,</m> and Z score <m>Z=0.92</m>:</p>

        <me>
          0.92 = Z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} = \frac{x - 70}{3.3}

    <title>Quantifying the variability of a statistic</title>

    <p>As seen in later chapters, it turns out that many of the statistics used to summarize data (e.g., the sample proportion, the sample mean, differences in two sample proportions, differences in two sample means, the sample slope from a linear model, etc.) vary according to the normal distribution seen above.</p>

    <p>The mathematical models are derived from the normal theory, but even the computational methods (and the intuitive thinking behind both approaches) use the general bell-shaped variability seen in most of the distributions constructed so far.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-68-95-99-7-rule">
      <title>68-95-99.7 rule</title>

    <p>Here, we present a useful general rule for the probability of falling within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean in the normal distribution.</p>

    <p>The rule will be useful in a wide range of practical settings, especially when trying to make a quick estimate without a calculator or Z table.</p>

      <p>Use <c>pnorm()</c> (or a Z table) to confirm that about 68%, 95%, and 99.7% of observations fall within 1, 2, and 3, standard deviations of the mean in the normal distribution, respectively.</p>
      <p>For instance, first find the area that falls between <m>Z=-1</m> and <m>Z=1,</m> which should have an area of about 0.68.</p>
      <p>Similarly there should be an area of about 0.95 between <m>Z=-2</m> and <m>Z=2.</m></p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
      <p>First draw the pictures.</p>
      <p>To find the area between <m>Z=-1</m> and <m>Z=1,</m> use <c>pnorm()</c> or the normal probability table to determine the areas below <m>Z=-1</m> and above <m>Z=1.</m> Next verify the area between <m>Z=-1</m> and <m>Z=1</m> is about 0.68.</p>
      <p>Repeat this for <m>Z=-2</m> to <m>Z=2</m> and for <m>Z=-3</m> to <m>Z=3.</m></p>

    <p>It is possible for a normal random variable to fall 4, 5, or even more standard deviations from the mean.</p>

    <p>However, these occurrences are very rare if the data are nearly normal.</p>

    <p>The probability of being further than 4 standard deviations from the mean is about 1-in-30,000.</p>

    <p>For 5 and 6 standard deviations, it is about 1-in-3.5 million and 1-in-1 billion, respectively.</p>

      <solution>
      <p>900 and 2100 represent two standard deviations above and below the mean, which means about 95% of test takers will score between 900 and 2100.</p>
      <p>Since the normal model is symmetric, then half of the test takers from part (a) (<m>\frac{95\%}{2} = 47.5\%</m> of all test takers) will score 900 to 1500 while 47.5% score between 1500 and 2100.</p>

      <p>Very related to the standard error is the <alert>margin of error</alert>\index{margin of error}.</p>

      <p>The margin of error describes how far away observations are from their mean.</p>

      <p>For example, to describe where most (i.e., 95%) observations lie, we say that the margin of error is approximately <m>2 \times SE</m>.</p>

      <p>That is, 95% of the observations are within two margins of error of the mean.</p>

      <assemblage>
        <p><alert>Margin of error for sample proportions.</alert></p>

        <p>The distance given by <m>z^\star \times SE</m> is called the <alert>margin of error</alert>\index{margin of error}.</p>

        <p><m>z^\star</m> is the cutoff value found on the normal distribution.</p>

        <p>The most common value of <m>z^\star</m> is 1.96 (often approximated to be 2) indicating that the margin of error describes the variability associated with 95% of the sampled statistics.</p>

      </assemblage>

      <p>Notice that if the spread of the observations goes from some lower bound to some upper bound, a rough approximation of the SE is to divide the range by 4.</p>

      <p>That is, if you notice the sample proportions go from 0.1 to 0.4, the SE can be approximated to be 0.075.</p>

    <title>Case Study (test): Opportunity cost</title>

    <p>The approach for using the normal model in the context of inference is very similar to the practice of applying the model to individual observations that are nearly normal.</p>

    <p>We will replace null distributions we previously obtained using the randomization or simulation techniques and verify the results once again using the normal model.</p>

    <p>When the sample size is sufficiently large, the normal approximation generally provides us with the same conclusions as the simulation model.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-opp-cost-observed-data">
      <title>Observed data</title>

    <p>In <xref ref="sec-caseStudyOpportunityCost" /> we were introduced to the opportunity cost study, which found that students became thriftier when they were reminded that not spending money now means the money can be spent on other things in the future.</p>

    <p>Let's re-analyze the data in the context of the normal distribution and compare the results.</p>

    <p><xref ref="fig-OpportunityCostDiffs-w-normal" /> summarizes the null distribution as determined using the randomization method.</p>

    <p>The best fitting normal distribution for the null distribution has a mean of 0.</p>

    <p>We can calculate the standard error of this distribution by borrowing a formula that we will become familiar with in <xref ref="ch17-inference-two-proportions" text="title" />, but for now let's just take the value <m>SE = 0.078</m> as a given.</p>

    <p>Recall that the point estimate of the difference was 0.20, as shown in <xref ref="fig-OpportunityCostDiffs-w-normal" />.</p>

    <p>Next, we'll use the normal distribution approach to compute the p-value.</p>

      <title>Observed statistic vs. null statistics</title>

    <p>As we learned in <xref ref="sec-normalDist" />, it is helpful to draw and shade a picture of the normal distribution so we know precisely what we want to calculate.</p>

    <p>Here we want to find the area of the tail beyond 0.2, representing the p-value.</p>

    <listing>
      <program language="r">
        <code>
        par(mar = c(2, 0, 0, 0))
        normTail(m = 0, s = 0.078, U = 0.2, col = IMSCOL["blue", "full"])
        </code>
      </program>
    </listing>

    <p>Next, we can calculate the Z score using the observed difference, 0.20, and the two model parameters.</p>

    <p>The standard error, <m>SE = 0.078,</m> is the equivalent of the model's standard deviation.</p>

    <me>
      Z = \frac{\text{observed difference} - 0}{SE} = \frac{0.20 - 0}{0.078} = 2.56
    </me>

    <p>We can either use statistical software or look up <m>Z = 2.56</m> in the normal probability table to determine the right tail area: 0.0052, which is about the same as what we got for the right tail using the randomization approach (0.006).</p>

    <p>Using this area as the p-value, we see that the p-value is less than 0.05, we conclude that the treatment did indeed impact students' spending.</p>

    <assemblage>
      <p><alert>Z score in a hypothesis test.</alert></p>

      <p>In the context of a hypothesis test, the Z score for a point estimate is</p>

      <me>
        Z = \frac{\text{point estimate} - \text{null value}}{SE}
      </me>

      <p>The standard error in this case is the equivalent of the standard deviation of the point estimate, and the null value comes from the claim made in the null hypothesis.</p>

    </assemblage>

    <p>We have confirmed that the randomization approach we used earlier and the normal distribution approach provide almost identical p-values and conclusions in the opportunity cost case study.</p>

    <p>Next, let's turn our attention to the medical consultant case study.</p>

    <title>Case study (test): Medical consultant</title>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-med-cons-observed-data">
      <title>Observed data</title>

    <p>In <xref ref="sec-case-study-med-consult" /> we learned about a medical consultant who reported that only 3 of their 62 clients who underwent a liver transplant had complications, which is less than the more common complication rate of 0.10.</p>

    <p>In that work, we did not model a null scenario, but we will discuss a simulation method for a one proportion null distribution in <xref ref="ch16-inference-single-proportion" />, such a distribution is provided in <xref ref="fig-MedConsNullSim-w-normal" />.</p>

    <p>We have added the best-fitting normal curve to the figure, which has a mean of 0.10.</p>

    <p>Borrowing a formula that we'll encounter in <xref ref="ch16-inference-single-proportion" text="title" />, the standard error of this distribution was also computed: <m>SE = 0.038.</m></p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-med-cons-variability">
      <title>Variability of the statistic</title>

    <p>Before we begin, we want to point out a simple detail that is easy to overlook: the null distribution we generated from the simulation is slightly skewed, and the histogram is not particularly smooth.</p>

    <p>In fact, the normal distribution only sort-of fits this model.</p>

    <figure xml:id="fig-MedConsNullSim-w-normal">
      <caption>The null distribution for the sample proportion, created from 10,000 simulated studies from the medical consultant, along with the best-fitting normal model.</caption>

    </figure>

    </subsection>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-med-cons-observed-vs-null">
      <title>Observed statistic vs. null statistics</title>

    <p>As always, we'll draw a picture before finding the normal probabilities.</p>

    <p>Below is a normal distribution centered at 0.10 with a standard error of 0.038.</p>

    <listing>
      <program language="r">
        <code>
        par(mar = c(2, 0, 0, 0))

        </code>
      </program>
    </listing>

    <p>Next, we can calculate the Z score using the observed complication rate, <m>\hat{p} = 0.048</m> along with the mean and standard deviation of the normal model.</p>

    <p>Here again, we use the standard error for the standard deviation.</p>

    <me>
      Z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{SE_{\hat{p}}} = \frac{0.048 - 0.10}{0.038} = -1.37
    </me>

    <p>Identifying <m>Z = -1.37</m> using statistical software or in the normal probability table, we can determine that the left tail area is 0.0853 which is the estimated p-value for the hypothesis test.</p>

    <p>There is a small problem: the p-value of 0.0853 is almost 30% smaller than the simulation p-value of 0.1222 which will be calculated in <xref ref="ch16-inference-single-proportion" />.</p>

    <p>The discrepancy is explained by the normal model's poor representation of the null distribution in <xref ref="fig-MedConsNullSim-w-normal" />.</p>

    <p>As noted earlier, the null distribution from the simulations is not very smooth, and the distribution itself is slightly skewed.</p>

    <p>That's the bad news.</p>

    <p>The good news is that we can foresee these problems using some simple checks.</p>

    <p>We'll learn more about these checks in the following chapters.</p>

    <p>In <xref ref="sec-CLTsection" /> we noted that the two common requirements to apply the Central Limit Theorem are (1) the observations in the sample must be independent, and (2) the sample must be sufficiently large.</p>

    <p>The guidelines for this particular situation -- which we will learn in <xref ref="ch16-inference-single-proportion" text="title" /> -- would have alerted us that the normal model was a poor approximation.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-med-cons-conditions">
      <title>Conditions for applying the normal model</title>

    <p>The success story in this section was the application of the normal model in the context of the opportunity cost data.</p>

    <p>However, the biggest lesson comes from the less successful attempt to use the normal approximation in the medical consultant case study.</p>

    <p>Statistical techniques are like a carpenter's tools.</p>

    <p>When used responsibly, they can produce amazing and precise results.</p>

    <p>However, if the tools are applied irresponsibly or under inappropriate conditions, they will produce unreliable results.</p>

    <p>For this reason, with every statistical method that we introduce in future chapters, we will carefully outline conditions when the method can reasonably be used.</p>

    <p>These conditions should be checked in each application of the technique.</p>

    <p>After covering the introductory topics in this course, advanced study may lead to working with complex models which, for example, bring together many variables with different variability structure.</p>

    <p>Working with data that come from normal populations makes higher-order models easier to estimate and interpret.</p>

    <p>There are times when simulation, randomization, or bootstrapping are unwieldy in either structure or computational demand.</p>

    <p>Normality can often lead to excellent approximations of the data using straightforward modeling techniques.</p>

    <p>The 68-95-99.7 rule tells us that, in general, 95% of observations are within 2 standard errors of the mean.</p>

    <p>As with hypothesis tests, confidence intervals are imperfect.</p>

            The General Social Survey asked the question: "For how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, not good?" Based on responses from 1,151 US residents, the survey reported a 95% confidence interval of 3.40 to 4.24 days in 2010.

            A nonprofit wants to understand the fraction of households that have elevated levels of lead in their drinking water.
            They expect at least 5% of homes will have elevated levels of lead, but not more than about 30%.
            They randomly sample 800 homes and work with the owners to retrieve water samples, and they compute the fraction of these homes with elevated lead levels.
