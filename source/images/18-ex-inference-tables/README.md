# Chapter 18 Exercise Images

This directory contains images for Chapter 18 exercises.

## Required Images

The following histogram images are needed for the exercises. These should show 1,000 randomized Chi-squared statistics:

1. **lizard-randomization-test.png** - Histogram for lizard habitat randomization test
   - Source: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e501f400-1ab9-4e23-b6bb-f4780df7bf9e
   - Shows Chi-squared distribution with observed value of 68.8 marked in red

2. **asian-tobacco-randomization-test.png** - Histogram for Asian American tobacco use randomization test
   - Source: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0daf4008-d84d-4b62-b361-c00f8de89238
   - Shows Chi-squared distribution with observed value of 209.42 marked in red

3. **lizard-larger-data-randomization.png** - Histogram for larger lizard habitat dataset
   - Source: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f23bd36f-c6ee-434e-aef1-7db1726d056e
   - Shows Chi-squared distribution for 5x larger dataset

4. **asian-tobacco-smaller-data-randomization.png** - Histogram for smaller Asian American tobacco dataset
   - Source: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdb921d1-ff69-4616-aab8-b1233ba385a0
   - Shows Chi-squared distribution for 50x smaller dataset with observed value of 4.19 marked in red

## Notes

⚠ **Important**: The GitHub user-attachments URLs provided above may be ephemeral and could expire.
If these links become unavailable, the images will need to be regenerated from the original data or 
obtained from another source. Consider archiving these images in a permanent location.

These images should be downloaded from the URLs above and placed in this directory with .png extensions.
They are Chi-squared randomization test histograms that visualize the null distribution.

The current .txt files are placeholders marking where the images should go.
Replace them with actual PNG images by downloading from the URLs above or regenerating them.
