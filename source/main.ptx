      <title>Introduction to data</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          The first part of the book will introduce you to data, their properties, how they are collected, and the structure of the design used for the study.
          Different data and settings lead to different <alert>types</alert> of conclusions, so you'll always want to keep in mind the data provenance, especially as you move on to modeling and inference.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              In <xref ref="sec-data-hello" /> you'll be introduced to tidy data, an important structure for describing, visualizing, and analyzing data.
            </p>

          <li>
            <p>
              In <xref ref="ch02-study-design" /> the focus is on study design.
              In particular, the critical distinction between random sampling and randomization is made.

          We recommend you come back to review this foundational part after you cover each new part in the textbook.
          In particular, it is worthwhile to consider <xref ref="fig-randsampValloc" /> in all of the inferential settings you cover.
          Each dataset you analyze will have a slightly different context which will require thoughtful consideration of the appropriate conclusions.

      <title>Exploratory data analysis</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          After obtaining a dataset, it is vitally important to understand the characteristics of the existing data. 
          Sometimes the most effective way to grasp the data is through summary statistics or other numerical measures. 
          Often, however, it is a picture that tells a thousand words. 
          Knowing how to best convey the underlying meaning in a dataset is a hugely important aspect of communicating results.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Categorical data is the focus of <xref ref="sec-explore-categorical" />. 
              Both numerical and graphical summaries are presented as ways to convey information about categorical data.

              Numerical data is the focus of <xref ref="ch05-exploring-numerical" />. 
              Both numerical and graphical summaries are presented as ways to convey information about numerical data.

            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          While our book is software agnostic, one of the best ways to become familiar with numerical and graphical summaries is to practice working with different datasets using statistical software. 
          For example, if you are interested in using R, you might try working through some of the chapters in <url href="https://r4ds.hadley.nz/">R for Data Science</url>, specifically the parts <url href="https://r4ds.hadley.nz/whole-game">Whole game</url> and <url href="https://r4ds.hadley.nz/visualize">Visualize</url>.

    <part xml:id="part-regression-modeling">
      <title>Regression modeling</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          Among the most ubiquitous methods used to model a response variable given one or more predictor variables is regression. 
          Linear regression is most commonly used when the response variable is numeric (and even better, continuous); logistic regression is used when the response variable is binary.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              In <xref ref="sec-model-slr" /> you are introduced to finding a best fit line using a least squares method. 
              Additionally, the correlation and coefficient of determination are presented as a way to describe the strength of the linear model.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In <xref ref="sec-model-mlr" /> the linear model is expanded to include multiple predictor variables in a single model. 
              We discuss the benefits as well as the pitfalls that can arise when using multiple predictors.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In <xref ref="sec-model-logistic" /> the response variable is constrained to be binary which changes the entire structure and produces the logistic regression model. 
              The similarities between the regression models (namely, linear combinations of the predictors) are presented. 
              Additionally, you see that the logistic regression predictions are now probabilities.

          Later on in the textbook, in the <url href="https://openintro-ims2.netlify.app/inferential-modeling">Inferential modeling</url> part, we will consider how a regression model built on a sample may or may not describe a particular population of interest.

    <part xml:id="part-foundations-of-inference">
      <title>Foundations of inference</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          Among the key concepts in statistics is making conclusions about a population using information in a sample; the process is called statistical inference. 
          By using computational methods as well as well-developed mathematical theory, we can understand how one dataset differs from a different dataset — even when the two datasets have been collected under identical settings. 
          In this part, we will walk through the key concepts and terms which will be applied more explicitly in later chapters.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <xref ref="ch11-hypothesis-testing-randomization" /> describes randomization which involves repeatedly permuting observations to represent scenarios in which there is no association between two variables of interest.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <xref ref="ch12-confidence-intervals-bootstrapping" /> describes bootstrapping which involves repeatedly sampling (with replacement) from the observed data in order to produce many samples which are similar to, but different from, the original data.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <xref ref="sec-foundations-mathematical" /> introduces the Central Limit Theorem which is a theoretical mathematical approximation to the variability in data seen through randomization and bootstrapping.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In <xref ref="ch14-decision-errors" /> you will be presented with a structure for describing when and how errors can happen within statistical inference.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <xref ref="sec-foundations-applications" /> includes an application on the Malaria vaccine case study where the topics from this part of the book are fully developed.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Although often computational and mathematical methods are both appropriate (and give similar results), your study of both approaches should convince you that (1) there is almost never a single "correct" approach, and (2) there are different ways to quantify the variability seen from dataset to dataset.

          While the previous part of the textbook, <url href="https://openintro-ims2.netlify.app/foundations-of-inference">Foundations of inference</url>, introduces the core of statistical inference, this part provides details for applying statistical inference in particular settings.
          Understanding the specific nuances given for different inferential methods can be helpful in communicating the resulting analyses.

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After working through the details in this part, you should have a good sense for how inferential methods are similar and different when applied to different data structures.
          Additionally, you should be able to apply both computational methods as well as mathematical techniques to the inference problem at hand.
