            <li>False. Instead of comparing counts, we should compare percentages of people in each group who suffered cardiovascular problems.</li>
            <li>True.</li>
            <li>False. Association does not imply causation. We cannot infer a causal relationship based on an observational study. The difference from part (ii) is subtle.</li>

        <li>Proportion of all patients who had cardiovascular problems: <m>\frac{7{,}979}{227{,}571} \approx 0.035</m></li>
        <li>The expected number of heart attacks in the Rosiglitazone group, if having cardiovascular problems and treatment were independent, can be calculated as the number of patients in that group multiplied by the overall cardiovascular problem rate in the study: <m>67{,}593 \times \frac{7{,}979}{227{,}571} \approx 2370</m>.</li>
        <li>
          <ol>
            <li><m>H_0</m>: The treatment and cardiovascular problems are independent. They have no relationship, and the difference in incidence rates between the Rosiglitazone and Pioglitazone groups is due to chance. <m>H_A</m>: The treatment and cardiovascular problems are not independent. The difference in the incidence rates between the Rosiglitazone and Pioglitazone groups is not due to chance and Rosiglitazone is associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular problems.</li>
            <li>A higher number of patients with cardiovascular problems than expected under the assumption of independence would provide support for the alternative hypothesis as this would suggest that Rosiglitazone increases the risk of such problems.</li>
            <li>In the actual study, we observed 2,593 cardiovascular events in the Rosiglitazone group. In the 100 simulations under the independence model, the simulated differences were never so high, which suggests that the actual results did not come from the independence model. That is, the variables do not appear to be independent, and we reject the independence model in favor of the alternative. The study's results provide convincing evidence that Rosiglitazone is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular problems.</li>

          <li>She scored 1.29 standard deviations above the mean on the Verbal Reasoning section and 0.52 standard deviations above the mean on the Quantitative Reasoning section.</li>
          <li>She did better on the Verbal Reasoning section since her Z score on that section was higher.</li>

          <li>We cannot compare the raw scores since they are on different scales. Comparing her percentile scores is more appropriate when comparing her performance to others.</li>
          <li>Answer to part (b) would not change as Z scores can be calculated for distributions that are not normal. However, we could not answer parts (d)-(f) since we cannot use the normal probability table to calculate probabilities and percentiles without a normal model.</li>

          <li>Recall that the general formula is <m>\text{point estimate} \pm z^{\star} \times SE</m>. First, identify the three different values. The point estimate is 45%, <m>z^{\star} = 1.96</m> for a 95% confidence level, and <m>SE = 1.2\%</m>. Then, plug the values into the formula: <m>45\% \pm 1.96 \times 1.2\% \rightarrow (42.6\%, 47.4\%)</m>.

            <ol>
              <li>False. Confidence intervals provide a range of plausible values, and sometimes the truth is missed. A 95% confidence interval "misses" about 5% of the time.</li>

              <li>True. If we examine the 95% confidence interval, we can see that 50% is not included in this interval. This means that in a hypothesis test, we would reject the null hypothesis that the proportion is 0.5.</li>
              <li>False. The standard error describes the uncertainty in the overall estimate from natural fluctuations due to randomness, not the uncertainty corresponding to individuals' responses.</li>

          <li>To know whether the distribution is skewed, we need to know the proportion. We've been told the proportion is likely above 5% and below 30%, and the success-failure condition would be satisfied for any of these values.
