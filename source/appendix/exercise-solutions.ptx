Make sure the cups are identical and contain equal amounts of soda. Label the cups (regular) and B (diet). (Be sure to randomize A and B for each trial!) (2) Give each participant the two cups, one cup at a time, in random order, and ask the participant to record a value that indicates how much she liked the beverage. Be sure that neither the participant nor the person handing out the cups knows the identity of the beverage to make this a double-blind experiment. (Answers may vary.)

Independence: Chicks are randomly assigned to feed types (presumably kept separate from one another), therefore independence of observations is reasonable. Approx. normal: the distributions of weights within each feed type appear to be fairly symmetric. Constant variance: Based on the side-by-side box plots, the constant variance assumption appears to be reasonable. There are differences in the actual computed standard deviations, but these might be due to chance as these are quite small samples. <m>F_{5,65} = 15.36</m> and the p-value is approximately 0.
