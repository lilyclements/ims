    <title>Experimental baker</title>
    <statement>
      <p>A baker working on perfecting their bagel recipe is experimenting with active dry (AD) and instant (I) yeast. They bake a dozen bagels with each type of yeast and score each bagel on a scale of 1 to 10 on how well the bagels rise. They come up with the following set of hypotheses for evaluating whether there is a difference in the average rise of bagels baked with active dry and instant yeast. What is wrong with the hypotheses as stated?</p>
      <p><me>H_0: \bar{x}_{AD} \leq \bar{x}_{I} \quad \quad H_A: \bar{x}_{AD} &gt; \bar{x}_{I}</me></p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>The hypotheses should use population means (<m>\mu</m>) not sample means (<m>\bar{x}</m>), the null hypothesis should set the two population means equal to each other, the alternative hypothesis should be two-tailed and use a not equal to sign.</p>

    <title>Diamonds, randomization test</title>
    <statement>
      <p>The prices of diamonds go up as the carat weight increases, but the increase is not smooth. For example, the difference between the size of a 0.99 carat diamond and a 1 carat diamond is undetectable to the naked human eye, but the price of a 1 carat diamond tends to be much higher than the price of a 0.99 carat diamond. We have two random samples of diamonds: 23 0.99 carat diamonds and 23 1 carat diamonds. In order to be able to compare equivalent units, we first divide the price for each diamond by 100 times its weight in carats. That is, for a 0.99 carat diamond, we divide the price by 99 and for a 1 carat diamond, we divide it by 100. Then, we randomize the carat weight to the price values in order simulate the null distribution of differences in average prices of 0.99 carat and 1 carat diamonds. The null distribution (with 1,000 randomized differences) is shown below and depicts the distribution of differences in sample means (of price per carat) if there really was no difference in the population from which these diamonds came.</p>

    <statement>
      <p>In order to assess physiological characteristics of common lizards, data on top speeds (in m/sec) measured on a laboratory race track for two species of lizards: Western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis) and Sagebrush lizard (Sceloporus graciosus).

    <title>Weight loss</title>
    <statement>
      <p>You are reading an article in which the researchers have created a 95% confidence interval for the difference in average weight loss for two diets. They are 95% confident that the true difference in average weight loss over 6 months for the two diets is somewhere between (1 lb, 25 lbs). The authors claim that, "therefore diet A (<m>\bar{x}_A</m> = 20 lbs average loss) results in a much larger average weight loss as compared to diet B (<m>\bar{x}_B</m> = 7 lbs average loss)." Comment on the authors' claim.</p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>The difference is not zero (statistically discernible), but there is no evidence that the difference is large (practically important), because the interval provides values as low as 1 lb.</p>

Also, we have no reason to think that the 0.99 carats are not independent of the 1 carat diamonds since they are both sampled randomly. Normality: The distributions are not extremely skewed, hence we can assume that the distribution of the average differences will be nearly normal as well. <m>T_{22} = -2.7</m>, p-value = 0.0131.

    <title>A/B testing</title>
    <statement>
      <p>A/B testing is a user experience research methodology where two variants of a page are shown to users at random. A company wants to evaluate whether users will spend more time, on average, on Page A or Page B using an A/B test. Two user experience designers at the company, Lucie and Müge, are tasked with conducting the analysis of the data collected. They agree on how the null hypothesis should be set: on average, users spend the same amount of time on Page A and Page B. Lucie believes that Page B will provide a better experience for users and hence wants to use a one-tailed test, Müge believes that a two-tailed test would be a better choice. Which designer do you agree with, and why?</p>

    <title>Mindfulness intervention for nurses</title>
    <statement>
      <p>In order to address extremely challenging and stressful situations for intensive care unit nurses, researchers ran a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) study on 60 nurses working in three hospitals in El-Beheira, Egypt. The participants were randomly allocated to one of the two groups: the treatment group (MBI) received 8 MBI sessions and the control group received no intervention. The nurses' emotional exhaustion was measured using 9 items from a questionnaire of the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel; the questions are recorded on a Likert scale where 0 indicated "Never" and 6 indicates "Every day". Nurses in the treatment group had an emotional exhaustion score of 15.47, with a standard deviation of 4.44, and nurses in the control group had an emotional exhaustion score of 32.43, with a standard deviation of 8.87. Do these data provide convincing evidence that the emotional exhaustion decrease is different for the patients in the treatment group compared to the control group?

    <title>Chicken diet: horsebean vs. linseed</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Chicken farming is a multi-billion dollar industry, and any methods that increase the growth rate of young chicks can reduce consumer costs while increasing company profits, possibly by millions of dollars. An experiment was conducted to measure and compare the effectiveness of various feed supplements on the growth rate of chickens.

      <p>Casein is a common weight gain supplement for humans. Does it have an effect on chickens? An experiment was conducted to measure and compare the effectiveness of various feed supplements on the growth rate of chickens.

Assume that the conditions for conducting inference using mathematical models are met, and using the data provided below, test the hypothesis that the average weight of chickens that were fed casein is different than the average weight of chickens that were fed soybean. If your hypothesis test yields a statistically discernible result, discuss whether the higher average weight of chickens can be attributed to the casein diet.</p>
