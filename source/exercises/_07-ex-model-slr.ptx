    <title>Meat consumption and life expectancy.</title>
    <statement>
      <p>In data collected for [You:2022], total meat intake is associated with life expectancy (at birth) in 175 countries. Meat intake is measured in kg per capita per year (averaged over 2011 to 2013). Additionally, the authors collected data on carbohydrate crops (e.g., cereals, root, sugar, etc.) in kg per capita per year (averaged over 2011 and 2013). The scatterplot on the left shows the life expectancy at birth plotted against the per capita meat consumption. The scatterplot on the right shows the amount of carbohydrate consumption plotted against the per capita meat consumption.</p>

      <p>A study conducted at the University of Denver investigated whether babies take longer to learn to crawl in cold months, when they are often bundled in clothes that restrict their movement, than in warmer months.

    <statement>
      <p>Determine if the following statements are true or false. If false, explain why.</p>
      <p><ol marker="a.">
        <li>A correlation coefficient of -0.90 indicates a stronger linear relationship than a correlation of 0.5.</li>
        <li>Correlation is a measure of the association between any two variables.</li>

    <title>Cherry trees.</title>
    <statement>
      <p>The scatterplots below show the relationship between height, diameter, and volume of timber in 31 felled black cherry trees. The diameter of the tree is measured 4.5 feet above the ground.<fn>The <c>trees</c> data used in this exercise can be found in the <alert>datasets</alert> R package.</fn></p>

    <title>Helmets and lunches.</title>
    <statement>
      <p>The scatterplot shows the relationship between socioeconomic status measured as the percentage of children in a neighborhood receiving reduced-fee lunches at school (<c>lunch</c>) and the percentage of bike riders in the neighborhood wearing helmets (<c>helmet</c>). The average percentage of children receiving reduced-fee lunches is [computed value]% with a standard deviation of [computed value]% and the average percentage of bike riders wearing helmets is [computed value]% with a standard deviation of [computed value]%.</p>
