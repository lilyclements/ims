    <title>GPA, mathematical interval</title>
    <statement>
      <p>A survey of 55 Duke University students asked about their GPA (<c>gpa</c>), number of hours they study weekly (<c>studyweek</c>), number of hours they sleep nightly (<c>sleepnight</c>), and whether they go out more than two nights a week (<c>out_mt2</c>). We use these data to build a model predicting GPA from the other variables. Summary of the model is shown below. Note that <c>out_mt2</c> is <c>1</c> if the student goes out more than two nights a week, and 0 otherwise.<fn>The <c>gpa</c> data used in this exercise can be found in the <c>openintro</c> R package.</fn></p>

    <title>Cherry trees, collinear predictors</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Timber yield is approximately equal to the volume of a tree, however, this value is difficult to measure without first cutting the tree down. Instead, other variables, such as height and diameter, may be used to predict a tree's volume and yield. Researchers wanting to understand the relationship between these variables for black cherry trees collected data from 31 such trees in the Allegheny National Forest, Pennsylvania. Height is measured in feet, diameter in inches (at 54 inches above ground), and volume in cubic feet.<fn>The <c>cherry</c> data used in this exercise can be found in the <c>openintro</c> R package.</fn> The plots below display the distribution of each of these variables (on the diagonal) as well as provide information on the pairwise correlations between them.</p>

    <title>Movie returns</title>
    <statement>
      <p>A FiveThirtyEight.com article reports that "Horror movies get nowhere near as much draw at the box office as the big-time summer blockbusters or action/adventure movies, but there's a huge incentive for studios to continue pushing them out. The return-on-investment potential for horror movies is absurd." To investigate how the return-on-investment (ROI) compares between genres and how this relationship has changed over time, an introductory statistics student fit a linear regression model to predict the ratio of gross revenue of movies to the production costs from genre and release year for 1,070 movies released between 2000 and 2018. Using the plots given below, determine if this regression model is appropriate for these data. In particular, use the residual plot to check the LINE conditons.</p>

    <title>Difficult encounters</title>
    <statement>
      <p>A study was conducted at a university outpatient primary care clinic in Switzerland to identify factors associated with difficult doctor-patient encounters. The data consist of 527 patient encounters, conducted by the 27 medical residents employed at the clinic. After each encounter, the attending physician completed two questionnaires: the Difficult Doctor Patient Relationship Questionnaire (DDPRQ-10) and the Patient's Vulnerability Grid (PVG). A higher score on the DDPRQ-10 indicates a more difficult encounter. The maximum possible score is 60 and encounters with score 30 and higher are considered difficult. A model was fit to predict DDPRQ-10 score from features of the attending physician: age, sex (male or not), and years of training.</p>

    <title>Baby's weight, mathematical test</title>
    <statement>
      <p>US Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collect information on births recorded in the country. The data used here are a random sample of 1,000 births from 2014. Here, we study the relationship between smoking and weight of the baby. The variable <c>smoke</c> is coded 1 if the mother is a smoker, and 0 if not. The summary table below shows the results of a linear regression model for predicting the average birth weight of babies, measured in pounds, based on the smoking status of the mother.<fn>The <c>births14</c> data used in this exercise can be found in the <c>openintro</c> R package.</fn></p>

      <p>Using a random sample of 1,000 US births from 2014, we study the relationship between the weight of the baby and various explanatory variables. The plots below display prediction errors associated with two different models designed to predict <c>weight</c> of baby at birth; one model uses 7 predictors, one model uses 2 predictors. Using 4-fold cross-validation, the data were split into 4 folds. Three of the folds estimate the <m>\beta_i</m> parameters using <m>b_i</m>, and the model is applied to the held out fold for prediction. The process was repeated 4 times (each time holding out one of the folds).</p>
