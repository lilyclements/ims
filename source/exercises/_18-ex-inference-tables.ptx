    <title>Quitters</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Does being part of a support group affect the ability of people to quit smoking?
A county health department enrolled 300 smokers in a randomized experiment.
150 participants were randomly assigned to a group that used a nicotine patch and met weekly with a support group; the other 150 received the patch and did not meet with a support group.
At the end of the study, 40 of the participants in the patch plus support group had quit smoking while only 30 smokers had quit in the other group.</p>

    <title>Act on climate change</title>
    <statement>
      <p>The table below summarizes results from a Pew Research poll which asked respondents whether they have personally taken action to help address climate change within the last year and their generation.
The differences in each generational group may be due to chance.
Complete the following computations under the null hypothesis of independence between an individual's generation and whether they have personally taken action to help address climate change within the last year.

    <title>Disaggregating Asian American tobacco use, data</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Understanding cultural differences in tobacco use across different demographic groups can lead to improved health care education and treatment.
A recent study disaggregated tobacco use across Asian American ethnic groups including Asian-Indian (n = 4,373), Chinese (n = 4,736), and Filipino (n = 4,912), in comparison to non-Hispanic Whites (n = 275,025).
The number of current smokers in each group was reported as Asian-Indian (n = 223), Chinese (n = 279), Filipino (n = 609), and non-Hispanic Whites (n = 50,880).

    <title>Disaggregating Asian American tobacco use, randomization test</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Understanding cultural differences in tobacco use across different demographic groups can lead to improved health care education and treatment.
A recent study disaggregated tobacco use across Asian American ethnic groups including Asian-Indian (n = 4373), Chinese (n = 4736), and Filipino (n = 4912), in comparison to non-Hispanic Whites (n = 275,025).
The number of current smokers in each group was reported as Asian-Indian (n = 223), Chinese (n = 279), Filipino (n = 609), and non-Hispanic Whites (n = 50,880).

    <statement>
      <p>Researchers conducted a study investigating the relationship between caffeinated coffee consumption and risk of depression in women.
They collected data on 50,739 women free of depression symptoms at the start of the study in the year 1996, and these women were followed through 2006.
The researchers used questionnaires to collect data on caffeinated coffee consumption, asked each individual about physician- diagnosed depression, and also asked about the use of antidepressants.
The table below shows the distribution of incidences of depression by amount of caffeinated coffee consumption.
