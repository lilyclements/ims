    <title>Body measurements, randomization test</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Researchers studying anthropometry collected body and skeletal diameter measurements, as well as age, weight, height and sex for 507 physically active individuals. A linear model is built to predict height based on shoulder girth (circumference of shoulders measured over deltoid muscles), both measured in centimeters. <xref ref="Heinz-2003" /> Shown below are the linear model output for predicting height from shoulder girth and the histogram of slopes from 1,000 randomized datasets (1,000 times, <c>hgt</c> was permuted and regressed against <c>sho_gi</c>). The red vertical line is drawn at the observed slope value which was produced in the linear model output.</p>

    <title>Beer and blood alcohol content</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Many people believe that weight, drinking habits, and many other factors are much more important in predicting blood alcohol content (BAC) than simply considering the number of drinks a person consumed. Here we examine data from sixteen student volunteers at Ohio State University who each drank a randomly assigned number of cans of beer. These students were evenly divided between men and women, and they differed in weight and drinking habits. Thirty minutes later, a police officer measured their blood alcohol content (BAC) in grams of alcohol per deciliter of blood. The scatterplot and regression table summarize the findings.</p>
