    <title>Air pollution and birth outcomes, study components</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Researchers collected data to examine the relationship between air pollutants and preterm births in Southern California. During the study, air pollution levels were measured by air quality monitoring stations. Specifically, levels of carbon monoxide were recorded in parts per million, nitrogen dioxide and ozone in parts per hundred million, and inhalable particulate matter (PM<m>_{10}</m>) in <m>\mu g/m^3</m>. Length of gestation data were collected on 143,196 births between the years 1989 and 1993, and air pollution exposure during gestation was calculated for each birth. The analysis suggested that increased ambient PM<m>_{10}</m> and, to a lesser degree, CO concentrations may be associated with the occurrence of preterm births. <xref ref="Ritz-Yu-Chapa-Fruin-2000" /></p>

    <statement>
      <p>Gamification is the application of game-design elements and game principles in non-game contexts. In educational settings, gamification is often implemented as educational activities to solve problems by using characteristics of game elements. Researchers investigating the effects of gamification on learning statistics conducted a study where they split college students in a statistics class into four groups: (1) no reading exercises and no gamification, (2) reading exercises but no gamification, (3) gamification but no reading exercises, and (4) gamification and reading exercises. Students in all groups also attended lectures. Students in the class were from two majors: Electrical and Computer Engineering (n = 279) and Business Administration (n = 86). After their assigned learning experience, each student took a final evaluation comprised of 30 multiple choice question and their score was measured as the number of questions they answered correctly. The researchers considered students' gender, level of studies (first through fourth year) and academic major. Other variables considered were expertise in the English language and use of personal computers and games, both of which were measured on a scale of 1 (beginner) to 5 (proficient). The study found that gamification had a positive effect on student learning compared to traditional teaching methods involving lectures and reading exercises. They also found that the effect was larger for females and Engineering students. <xref ref="Legaki-2020" /></p>

    <title>Migraine and acupuncture</title>
    <statement>
      <p>A migraine is a particularly painful type of headache, which patients sometimes wish to treat with acupuncture. To determine whether acupuncture relieves migraine pain, researchers conducted a randomized controlled study where 89 individuals who identified as female diagnosed with migraine headaches were randomly assigned to one of two groups: treatment or control. Forty-three (43) patients in the treatment group received acupuncture that is specifically designed to treat migraines. Forty-six (46) patients in the control group received placebo acupuncture (needle insertion at non-acupoint locations). Twenty-four (24) hours after patients received acupuncture, they were asked if they were pain free. Results are summarized in the contingency table below. <xref ref="Allais-2011" /></p>

    <title>Daycare fines, study components</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Researchers tested the deterrence hypothesis which predicts that the introduction of a penalty will reduce the occurrence of the behavior subject to the fine, with the condition that the fine leaves everything else unchanged, by instituting a fine for late pickup at daycare centers. For this study, they worked with 10 volunteer daycare centers that did not originally impose a fine to parents for picking up their kids late. They randomly selected 6 of these daycare centers and instituted a monetary fine (of a considerable amount) for picking up children late and then removed it. In the remaining 4 daycare centers no fine was introduced. The study period was divided into four: before the fine (weeks 1–4), the first 4 weeks with the fine (weeks 5-8), the last 8 weeks with fine (weeks 9–16), and the after fine period (weeks 17-20). Throughout the study, the number of kids who were picked up late was recorded each week for each daycare. The study found that the number of late-coming parents increased discernibly when the fine was introduced, and no reduction occurred after the fine was removed. <xref ref="Gneezy-2000" /></p>
