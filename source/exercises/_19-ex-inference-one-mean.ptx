    <title>Length of gestation, confidence interval</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Every year, the United States Department of Health and Human Services releases to the public a large dataset containing information on births recorded in the country. This dataset has been of interest to medical researchers who are studying the relation between habits and practices of expectant mothers and the birth of their children. In this exercise we work with a random sample of 1,000 cases from the dataset released in 2014. The length of pregnancy, measured in weeks, is commonly referred to as gestation. The histograms below show the distribution of lengths of gestation from the random sample of 1,000 births (on the left) and the distribution of bootstrapped means of gestation from 1,500 different bootstrap samples (on the right).</p>
