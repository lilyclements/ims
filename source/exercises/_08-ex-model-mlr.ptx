    <title>High correlation, good or bad?</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Two friends, Frances and Annika, are in disagreement about whether high correlation values are <em>always</em> good in the context of regression. Frances claims that it's desirable for all variables in the dataset to be highly correlated to each other when building linear models. Annika claims that while it's desirable for each of the predictors to be highly correlated with the outcome, it is not desirable for the predictors to be highly correlated with each other. Who is right: Frances, Annika, both, or neither? Explain your reasoning using appropriate terminology.</p>

    <title>Dealing with categorical predictors.</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Two friends, Elliott and Adrian, want to build a model predicting typing speed (average number of words typed per minute) from whether the person wears glasses or not. Before building the model they want to conduct some exploratory analysis to evaluate the strength of the association between these two variables, but they're in disagreement about how to evaluate how strongly a categorical predictor is associated with a numerical outcome. Elliott claims that it is not possible to calculate a correlation coefficient to summarize the relationship between a categorical predictor and a numerical outcome, however they're not sure what a better alternative is. Adrian claims that you can recode a binary predictor as a 0/1 variable (assign one level to be 0 and the other to be 1), thus converting it to a numerical variable. According to Adrian, you can then calculate the correlation coefficient between the predictor and the outcome. Who is right: Elliott or Adrian? If you pick Elliott, can you suggest a better alternative for evaluating the association between the categorical predictor and the numerical outcome?</p>

    <title>Meat consumption and life expectancy.</title>
    <statement>
      <p>In data collected for <xref ref="You-2022"/>, total meat intake is associated with life expectancy (at birth) in 175 countries. Meat intake is measured in kg per capita per year (averaged over 2011 to 2013). The scatterplot on the top left displays the relationship between life expectancy at birth vs. per capita meat consumption. The scatterplot on the top right displays the same relationship colored by income status of the country. The set of scatterplots across the bottom display the same relationship by income status of the country. </p>

    <title>Arrival delays.</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Consider all of the flights out of New York City in 2013 that flew into Puerto Rico (BQN) or San Francisco (SFO) on the following two airlines: JetBlue (B6) or United Airlines (UA). We consider the relationship between day of the year and arrival delay (in minutes). Note that a negative arrival delay means that the flight arrived early. The figures display a least squares regression line for arrival delay versus time (day of the year).<fn>The <c>flights</c> data used in this exercise can be found in the <url href="https://github.com/tidyverse/nycflights13"><alert>nycflights13</alert></url> R package.</fn> </p>

    <statement>
      <p>Nico signs up for a 5K (a 5,000 metre running race) 30 days prior to the race. They decide to run a 5K every day to train for it, and each day they record the following information: <c>days_since_start</c> (number of days since starting training), <c>days_till_race</c> (number of days left until the race), <c>mood</c> (poor, good, awesome), <c>tiredness</c> (1-not tired to 10-very tired), and <c>time</c> (time it takes to run 5K, recorded as mm:ss). Top few rows of the data they collect is shown below. Using these data Nico wants to build a model predicting <c>time</c> from the other variables. Should they include all variables shown above in their model? Why or why not? </p>

      <p>US Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collect information on births recorded in the country. The data used here are a random sample of 1,000 births from 2014. Here, we study the relationship between smoking and weight of the baby. The variable <c>smoke</c> is coded 1 if the mother is a smoker, and 0 if not. The summary table below shows the results of a linear regression model for predicting the average birth weight of babies, measured in pounds, based on the smoking status of the mother.<fn>The <url href="http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/births14.html"><c>births14</c></url> data used in this exercise can be found in the <url href="http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro"><alert>openintro</alert></url> R package.</fn> <xref ref="data-births14"/> </p>

    <title>Baby weights, forward selection.</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Using information on the mother and the sex of the baby (which can be determined prior to birth), we want to build a model that predicts the birth weight of babies.

And we will make a decision about including them in the model using forward selection and adjusted <m>R^2</m>. Below are the six models we evaluate and their adjusted <m>R^2</m> values. <xref ref="data-births14"/> Which variable should be added to the model first?</p>
