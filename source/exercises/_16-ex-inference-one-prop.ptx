    <title>Do aliens exist?</title>
    <statement>
      <p>In May 2021, YouGov asked 4,839 adult Great Britain residents whether they think aliens exist, and if so, if they have or have not visited Earth. You want to evaluate if more than a quarter (25%) of Great Britain adults think aliens don't exist. In the survey 22% responded <q>I think they exist, and have visited Earth</q>, 28% responded <q>I think they exist, but have not visited Earth</q>, 29% responded <q>I don't think they exist</q>, and 22% responded <q>Don't know</q>. A friend of yours offers to help you with setting up the hypothesis test and comes up with the following hypotheses. Indicate any errors you see. <m>H_0: \hat{p} = 0.29 \quad \quad H_A: \hat{p} > 0.29</m></p>

    <statement>
      <p>A study suggests that the 25% of 25 year-olds have gotten married. You believe that this is incorrect and decide to collect your own sample for a hypothesis test. From a random sample of 776 25 year-olds, you find that 24% of them are married. A friend of yours offers to help you with setting up the hypothesis test and comes up with the following hypotheses. Indicate any errors you see. <m>H_0: \hat{p} = 0.24 \quad \quad H_A: \hat{p} \neq 0.24</m></p>

    <statement>
      <p>Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) is a collection of techniques that help facilitate pregnancy (e.g., in vitro fertilization).

    <statement>
      <p>The results of a study on the type of enclosed spaces cats are most likely to sit in show that 5 out of 7 cats chose a square taped to the ground over a shape known as <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_contours#Kanizsa_figures">Kanizsa square illusion</url>, which was preferred by the remaining 2 cats. To evaluate whether these data provide convincing evidence that cats prefer one of the shapes over the other, we set <m>H_0: p = 0.5</m>, where <m>p</m> is the population proportion of cats who prefer square over the Kanizsa square illusion and <m>H_A: p \neq 0.5</m>, which suggests some preference, without specifying which shape is more preferred. <xref ref="Smith:2021" /></p>

    <title>Statistics and employment, describe the bootstrap</title>
    <statement>
      <p>A large university knows that about 70% of the full-time students are employed at least 5 hours per week. The members of the Statistics Department wonder if the same proportion of their students work at least 5 hours per week. They randomly sample 25 majors and find that 15 of the students work 5 or more hours each week. Two sampling distributions are created to describe the variability in the proportion of statistics majors who work at least 5 hours per week. The null hypothesis simulation imposes a true population proportion of <m>p = 0.7</m> while the data bootstrap resamples from the actual data (which has 60% of the observations who work at least 5 hours per week).</p>

    <title>Taste test</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Some people claim that they can tell the difference between a diet soda and a regular soda in the first sip. A researcher wanting to test this claim randomly sampled 80 such people. He then filled 80 plain white cups with soda, half diet and half regular through random assignment, and asked each person to take one sip from their cup and identify the soda as diet or regular. 53 participants correctly identified the soda.</p>
      <p><ol marker="a.">
        <li><p>Do these data provide strong evidence that these people are able to detect the difference between diet and regular soda, in other words, are the results discernibly better than just random guessing? Your response should use a mathematical model.</p></li>
        <li><p>Interpret the p-value in this context.</p></li>

    <title>Will the coronavirus bring the world closer together?</title>
    <statement>
      <p>In early 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in the US; by December 2020 the first COVID-19 vaccine was available. An April 2021 YouGov poll asked 4,265 UK adults whether they think the coronavirus bring the world closer together or leave us further apart. 12% of the respondents said it will bring the world closer together. 37% said it would leave us further apart, 39% said it won't make a difference and the remainder didn't have an opinion on the matter. <xref ref="data:yougovcovid" /></p>
      <p><ol marker="a.">
        <li><p>Calculate, using a mathematical model, a 90% confidence interval for the proportion of UK adults who think the coronavirus will bring the world closer together, and interpret the interval in context.</p></li>

    <statement>
      <p>As part of a quality control process for computer chips, an engineer at a factory randomly samples 212 chips during a week of production to test the current rate of chips with severe defects. She finds that 27 of the chips are defective.</p>

    <title>Nearsighted children</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Nearsightedness (myopia) is a common vision condition in which you can see near objects clearly, but farther away objects blurry. It is believed that nearsightedness affects about 8% of all children. In a random sample of 194 children, 21 are nearsighted. Using a mathematical model, conduct a hypothesis test for the following question: do these data provide evidence that the 8% value is inaccurate?</p>

    <statement>
      <p>A website is trying to increase registration for first-time visitors, exposing 1% of these visitors to a new site design. Of 752 randomly sampled visitors over a month who saw the new design, 64 registered.</p>
