    <title>Cuckoo bird egg lengths, randomize once</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Cuckoo birds lay their eggs in other birds' nests, making them known as brood parasites. One question relates to whether the size of the cuckoo egg differs depending on the species of the host bird. <xref ref="Latter-1902" /> Consider the following plots, one represents the original data, the second represents data where the host species has been randomly assigned to the egg length.</p>

      <p><ol marker="a.">
        <li><p>Consider the average length of the eggs for each species. Is the average length for the original data: more variable, less variable, or about the same as the randomized species? Describe what you see in the plots.</p></li>
        <li><p>Consider the standard deviation of the lengths of the eggs within each species. Is the within species standard deviation of the length for the original data: bigger, smaller, or about the same as the randomized species?</p></li>
        <li><p>Recall that the F statistic's numerator measures how much the groups vary (MSG) with the denominator measuring how much the within species values vary (MSE), which of the plots above would have a larger F statistic, the original data or the randomized data? Explain.</p></li>

    <title>Cuckoo bird egg lengths, randomization test</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Cuckoo birds lay their eggs in other birds' nests, making them known as brood parasites. One question relates to whether the size of the cuckoo egg differs depending on the species of the host bird. <xref ref="Latter-1902" /> Using the randomization distribution of the F statistic (host species randomized to egg length), conduct a hypothesis test to evaluate if there is a difference, in the population, between the average egg lengths for different host bird species. Make sure to state your hypotheses clearly and interpret your results in context of the data.</p>

    <title>Teaching descriptive statistics</title>
    <statement>
      <p>A study compared five different methods for teaching descriptive statistics. The five methods were traditional lecture and discussion, programmed textbook instruction, programmed text with lectures, computer instruction, and computer instruction with lectures. 45 students were randomly assigned, 9 to each method. After completing the course, students took a 1-hour exam.</p>

    <title>Coffee, depression, and physical activity</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Caffeine is the world's most widely used stimulant, with approximately 80% consumed in the form of coffee. Participants in a study investigating the relationship between coffee consumption and exercise were asked to report the number of hours they spent per week on moderate (e.g., brisk walking) and vigorous (e.g., strenuous sports and jogging) exercise. Based on these data the researchers estimated the total hours of metabolic equivalent tasks (MET) per week, a value always greater than 0. The table below gives summary statistics of MET for women in this study based on the amount of coffee consumed. <xref ref="Lucas-2011" /></p>

    <title>Child care hours</title>
    <statement>
      <p>The China Health and Nutrition Survey aims to examine the effects of the health, nutrition, and family planning policies and programs implemented by national and local governments. <xref ref="data-china" /> It, for example, collects information on number of hours Chinese parents spend taking care of their children under age 6. The side-by-side box plots below show the distribution of this variable by educational attainment of the parent. Also provided below is the ANOVA output for comparing average hours across educational attainment categories.</p>
