      <p>Air quality measurements were collected in a random sample of 25 country capitals in 2013, and then again in the same cities in 2014. We would like to use these data to compare average air quality between the two years. Should we use a paired or non-paired test? Explain your reasoning.</p>

    <title>High School and Beyond, randomization test</title>
    <statement>
      <p>The National Center of Education Statistics conducted a survey of high school seniors, collecting test data on reading, writing, and several other subjects. Here we examine a simple random sample of 200 students from this survey.</p>
      
      <p>Side-by-side box plots of reading and writing scores as well as a histogram of the differences in scores are shown below. Also provided below is a histogram of randomized averages of paired differences of scores (read - write), with the observed difference (<m>\bar{x}_{read-write} = -0.545</m>) marked with a red vertical line. The randomization distribution was produced by doing the following 1000 times: for each student, the two scores were randomly assigned to either read or write, and the average was taken across all students in the sample.<fn>The <c>hsb2</c> data used in this exercise can be found in the <c>openintro</c> R package.</fn></p>

    <title>Global warming, randomization test</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Let's consider a limited set of climate data, examining temperature differences in 1950 vs 2022. We sampled 26 locations in the US from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) historical data, where the data was available for both years of interest. The data are not a random sample, but they are selected to be a representative sample across the land area of the lower 48 United States. Using the hottest day of the year as a measure can make the results susceptible to outliers. Instead, to get a sense for how hot a year was, we calculate the 90<m>^{th}</m> percentile; that is, we find the maximum temperature on the day that was hotter than 90% of the days that year. We want to know: is the 90<m>^{th}</m> percentile high temperature greater in 2022 or in 1950? The difference in 90<m>^{th}</m> percentile high temperature (high temperature for 2022 - high temperature for 1950) was calculated for each of the 26 locations. The average of the 26 differences was 2.52<m>^\circ</m>F with a standard deviation of 2.95<m>^\circ</m>F. We are interested in determining whether these data provide strong evidence that the 90<m>^{th}</m> percentile high temperature is higher in 2022 than in 1950.<fn>The <c>us_temperature</c> data used in this exercise can be found in the <c>openintro</c> R package.</fn></p>
